My efforts on working on dog breed identification problem: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification.

I tried to use pretrained VGG16 model fixing some first layers. I also try simple hand-made CNN model. These models can be found in the corresponding files. File __Statistics.ipynb__ contains some output statistics from all the notebooks compilated together.
